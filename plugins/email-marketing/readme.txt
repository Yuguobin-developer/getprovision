== DESCRIPTION ==

**Do you sell online? If so you need [our new Drip for WooCommerce Plugin instead of this one](https://wordpress.org/plugins/drip/). It includes your entire product catalog, order history integration, revenue tracking, and much more.**

[Drip](https://www.drip.com) is an email and SMS marketing automation platform for growing ecommerce brands who want to take their email marketing to the next level.

Part of Drip’s power comes from its JavaScript web tracking code, which lets you build a direct link between your WordPress site and your Drip account. Once your code is all set up, you can start triggering automations and display popups based on who’s on your site and which pages they’re checking out.

The best part? It’s the easiest thing you’ll set up all day. It takes just one click to install the Drip plugin. And once it’s in, you’re ready to start collecting more leads, gaining new insights, and triggering more automations all across your website.

Check out [Drip.com](https://www.drip.com) to learn more about how we can help you and your business.
