	<div class="toggle-box-content">
		<div class="toogle-column">
			<p>All natural gas plans offer 100% carbon offset natural gas. This means that when you use
				natural gas at home, Provision invests in carbon-reducing projects on your behalf,
				proportionate to the amount of carbon released by your energy use. In this way, your home
				natural gas use is considered carbon neutral.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="toogle-column">
			<p>But carbon neutral is not enough. In addition to 100% carbon offset natural gas, all Provision
				plans plant trees. Trees are carbon-capturing superheroes, using carbon to grow through
				photosynthesis. The more trees we plant, the more carbon we capture.</p>
